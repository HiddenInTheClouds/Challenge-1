# Challenge-1-CSS-Cleanup

## This repo contains code that was changed to clean up unecessary CSS and HTML.

The code that was recieved to be condensed and cleaned up contained many non-semantic elements in the HTML that needed to be changed. These elements like the <div> sections were changed to follow what role they played in the HTML such as: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer>.
The images that were on the website were also given alt tags to give descriptions of what they were which would help for better accessibility and SEO.
The CSS stylesheet was changed by giving class selectors to certain elements that contained the same attributes, therefore, condensing the code and removing unecessary individual selectors.
I learned that whenever certain elements are given the same styling attributes that it is clean and more concise to create a class selector for these elements. I also learned that the <div> sections while they are generic and keep the formatting the same, it is a much better practice to give them semantic elements so that those who are disabled can understand what role these elements play in regards to a web application.

## Installation

For installation one would need to push their code from their local repo into GitHub.
